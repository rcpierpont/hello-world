introduction to using github and repositories

Currently working full-time as a barista while I learn how to code for fun.  I have taken a couple beginner courses at a local university that gave me an introduction to coding in Java and C while also confirming my interest in the field.  Since I already have a (mostly unrelated) bachelor's degree, I've decided to start teaching myself useful skills for software development in my spare time until I'm able to find employment as a software developer.  Currently I'm learning how to program in C while also learning linux and related tools.

So far these are topics that I have been exposed to at least for the languages I've worked with.  This list is for others to gauge what I can do and for me to document my progress.

Basic data storage and flow of control:
-simple data types and declaring and initializing variables
-commonly used control structures such as if/else, for-loops, while-loops, and switch-statements
-defining and using functions
-declaring and using multi-dimensional arrays
-pointers and structuress

Libraries:
-stdio: using the input/output streams to manipulate and store data in files
-stdlib: memory allocation and arrays of structures
-string: string manipulation

Other topics:
-bubble sort
-stack and linked-list data structures

Development, debugging and version control tools:
-gcc
-make
-gdb
-valgrind
